        Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an American media franchise created by
        the comic book artists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. It follows
        Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael, four anthropomorphic
        turtle brothers (named after Italian Renaissance artists) trained in
        ninjutsu who fight evil in New York City. <br /><br />
        As you are not aware, each of these Ninja Turtles has its own weapons
        and I have created an overall stylization design of their weapons.
